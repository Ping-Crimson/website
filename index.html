				<p><strong>Chess</strong><a href="Pages/chess.html"> (Learn More)</a></p>
				<ul class="featured-projects-list">
					<li>I’m enthusiastic about chess because it is a fun and provoking game. I find the way chess pieces interact with each other fascinatingly complex; even after playing for more than five years I’m far from mastering the game</li>
					<li>I have achieved <strong>Chess Master</strong> level. I won state tournament in Washington State Elementary Chess Championships. The 500 I won in Gloden Horse Chess tournament is the first time I made some money</li>
					<li>I learned being a good sport and be patient. Keep moving and keep thinking</li>
				</ul>

			<div class="featured-row">
				<p><strong>Dancing</strong><a href="Pages/dancing.html"> (Learn More)</a></p>
				<ul class="featured-projects-list">
					<li>I like dancing because it is a way to express myself and it looks really cool</li>
					<li>I take classes and practice on my own. I have been dancing hip hop and I am recently working on popping</li>
					<li>Dancing really helps me become confident. It looks awkward first but to perform in front of people, the dancer has to be confident and watch for every move as well the facial expression. So, when I dance, I need to put on a confident face as a way to watch for my moves and facial expression. That helps me feel confident</li>
				</ul>

			<div class="featured-row">
				<p><strong>Soccer</strong><a href="Pages/projects.html"> (Learn More)</a></p>
				<ul class="featured-projects-list">
					<li>I like soccer because it is a team game that requires both physical skills and trusting your teammates. I find it very fun</li>
					<li>My team has won the second place in regional tournament. I played in school varsity team representing the school</li>
					<li>I learned teamwork and trusting my teammate. Once I start consistently train with a team, I learned to work together with my teammates and figure out our affirmations without even consulting a coach</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>Programming</strong><a href="Pages/projects.html"> (Learn More)</a></p>
				<ul class="featured-projects-list">
					<li>I like programing because it is related to math and technology and combine both into one. It also allows me to be creative and tinkering and immerse myself into the world of engineering</li>
					<li>I enjoy creating my own projects and look over other projects in engineer. I have created multiple games, such as website games, image scanner, website</li>
					<li>I learn the programming mindset: be organized and ready to learn new things; different languages used in codes, always meet things I don’t know; I also learned to be consistent with the effort</li>
